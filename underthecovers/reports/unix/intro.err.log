We visualized a running Unix system with the Hardware of the computer at the bottom, shaded 
blue, and the running software, shaded in green, above it.  The Unix Kernel is a persistent 
program that forms the foundation for launching and running instances of user programs and 
is illustrated as the green oval labeled "UNIX Kernel".  The smaller green circles represent 
the currently running programs that have been started. Each time a program is started we 
visualize a new circle representing a new running instances of the program.   In the diagram 
each is labeled with the program that was used to start it. Each instance is independent and 
has its own "life-time".   If a specific running instance of a program ends, crashes or is 
terminated (killed) by the user we would remove its circle.  So while in reality we can't 
physically see the programs running we none the less think of the running software as forming 
a world of its own, inside the machine, with the kernel enabling its construction and management.
